This programs pre-processing binary image data(e.g. SIFT1B, TinyImage 80M) using Spark. 
How to use: take GIST1M (http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/) as example

Assume we have already cd into working directory, i.e. sparkapp/image, we take the processing of SIFT1B as example.

USAGE:

1. Prepare dataset
    a. Upload dataset to HDFS

        hadoop dfs dfs.blocksize=67108864 -put bigann_base.bvecs /datasets/image/ANN_SIFT1B-raw/bigann_base.bvecs
         
        EXPLAIN: We define each block in HDFS has 64MB (i.e. 64 * 1024 * 1024 = 67108864 bytes), and have about 132 GB / 64MB = 2000 blocks. Each block is owned and processed by exactly a Spark executor. Enough blocks ensure good parallelism.  

2. Prepare inputformat
    a. Compile terasort inputformat (For reading binary file)
        cd inputformat
        mvn package
        cd ../

3. Start spark shell with compiled jar (under target/spark-terasort-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar)
    a. Modify open-shell.sh and do the configuration (e.g. specify the location of spark-shell as /data/opt/spark-2.0.2/bin in the example)

    b. Open the shell
        sh open-shell.sh

    c. Copy source code line by line to spark-shell
        index.scala should be used at the very beginning to index vectors
        Other scala files only accept indexed vectors produced by index.scala

        EXPLAIN: In distributed manner, we cannot decide which chunk is processed by which worker, thus we need to index all the vectors at the very beginning



DESCRIPTION:

TeraInputFormat.scala:
    Key is set to 4 bytes and Value is set to 128 bytes, both of which can be modified for your application scenario.

TeraOutputFormat.scala:
    Output key value pairs in binary format

All scala files use TeraInputFormat.scala to deseiralize binary vectors.
All scala files use TeraOutputFormat.scala to seiralize binary vectors.

index.scala:
    Input: vectors in binary format 
    Functionality: Index vectors (id starts from 0)
    Output: indexed vectors in text format, (id feature1 feature2,..., )

mean.scala:
    Input: vectors outputed by index.scala
    Output: zero-centered vectors in text format, (id, feature1 feature2,...,)
    
cal_groundtruth.scala:
    Input1: indexed query vectors 
    Input2: indexed item vectors
    Output: top-k items, together with distance of each query (in text)
